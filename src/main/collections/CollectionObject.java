 * <p>Basic Collection with type Object</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Upon insertion, a contract is made between the user and implementation
 * of a Jentry Collection that a compact int will be returned. Compact
 * means that ints will be returned in a consecutive order starting with 0.
 * When items are removed, their ints are re-used. One may use these ints
 * to quickly retrieve the inserted values.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The compactness of these int 'handles' means that parallel
 * information can be stored in an array directly, without wasting space.
 * The retrieval of this information is usually a direct
 * array access.
 * </p>
 * <p>This pattern uses more space in storing the objects, however the
 * compact-ness usually ends up saving space for related structures, and
 * like most array-based collections, can out-perform JDK structures at large
 * sizes and when garbage collection is taken into account.
