 * Similar to the JDK Collection, this will describe the collections
 * in the Jentry collections package. Very similar to the JDK collections,
 * with the one addition of entries.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Upon insertion, a contract is made between the user and implementation
 * of a Jentry Collection that a compact int will be returned. Compact
 * means that ints will be returned in a consecutive order starting with 0.
 * When items are removed, their ints are re-used. Upon retrieval of these
 * items, one may just use the entry and quickly access the value.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The compactness of these int 'handles' means that parallel
 * information can be stored in an array directly, without wasting space.
 * The retrieval of this information from these ints is usually a direct
 * array access (or maybe one level of indirection), which is very
 * quick. </p>
 * <p>This pattern uses more space in storing the objects, however the
 * compact-ness usually ends up saving space for related structures, and
 * performs many operations much more efficiently than JDK structures.
 * </p>
 * <p>A second advantage to Jentry Collections is their Object
 * 'stingyness', in that it gives users great control over their memory,
 * and it deals with primitives. This becomes a huge advantage vs inserting
 * and removing Objects, which must be cleaned up, for very large collections.
 * Instead of wasting time with Object allocation and garbage cleaning,
 * the collection will be long-lived until it is completely
 * unnecessary.</p>
