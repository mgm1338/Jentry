 * <p/>
 * <p>A Binary heap of keys</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The Heap will take a {@link Comparator_KeyTypeName_} ordering it
 * so that the parent item will always evalute to be greater than the children.
 * For instance, the {@link core.util.comparator.Comparators._KeyTypeName_Asc}
 * will ensure that the parent item will be less (in value) than the children items
 * .<p>
 * <p>The following heaps (using int as type) are both valid for an IntAsc
 * Comparator.
 * <pre>
 *            1
 *          /  \
 *         3    2
 *        / \
 *      10  11
 * </pre>
 * and also,
 * <pre>
 *         1
 *       /  \
 *      10   2
 *          / \
 *         3  11
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Note that the same elements can take different orders in a Heap (differing
 * from a Binary tree), so the Heap should not be used for searching. The Heap's
 * purpose is collecting the 'greatest' item as its top element. Another typical
 * use is sorting items with a relatively small memory footprint.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The singly-typed heap is simply a collection of keys, that are guaranteed
 * to be sorted as described above. The Heap follows the general convention
 * of other Jentry structures, that insertion will yield a handle to that item.
 * The Heap guarantees that retrieval using that entry will remain consistent,
 * and that upon removal, the next entry will re-use the vacated spot.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The Heap has the typical insertion and removal conventions, such that
 * the insertion and removal is done in log(n). To insert, we insert
 * into the next natural leaf position and flip the item with its parents
 * until it is in the correct position. When removing, we flip the removed
 * item with the top position, and switch the item with its children
 * until it is in the correct position.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <p><strong>Structure</strong></p>
 * <p/>
 * Internally the Heap will store its items in a binary tree formed as an array.
 * The array will start at index 1 for the sole reason that doing parent
 * and child math is quicker than starting from 0, and it doesn't use much
 * extra space. When visualizing a tree from an array, the indices in the array are as follows:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *          1
 *        /   \
 *       2     3
 *      / \   / \
 *     4  5  6   7
 * </pre>
 * and so on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The tree array will store the entries of the collection that are inserted, not the values themselves. This requires
 * an array that will store the values (<i>key</i> array). We also need an 'inverse array', which for a given key
 * , will store the spot in the tree. This last array will allow us to remove a key without having to search. Like
 * the other Jentry structure, upon insertion, a handle to the key will be returned. This handle, when
 * used to retrieve an item, is guaranteed to return the key inserted. Upon removal of a key, the corresponding
 * handle will be returned.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
